This is an in-progress waste of time. I wanted making screenshots of macOS menu items to be easier and automatable. So this happened. 

The niftymenu.rb script can copy the entire contents of any app's menubar and turn it into a working HTML playground with all the features you'd want when writing user documentation. Check out testMenu.html in a browser to see what's up.
